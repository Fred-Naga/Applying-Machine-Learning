            Choosing where to start a business is always a difficult decision. Rather than relying on 
            evidence-based strategies, entrepreneurs often make decisions based on intuition or 
            outdated heuristics, which can lead to significant resource misallocation. A predictive 
            algorithm that estimates item-level gross profit can support data-driven decision making 
            and help entrepreneurs develop successful business strategies. As a first step, we 
            develop an algorithm to project item-level gross profits in liquor stores, using Iowa 
            liquor sales data.          

            <u><b>Research Questions</b></u>
            - How can we leverage demographic, economic, and liquor sales data to develop a 
            predictive algorithm that helps liquor store owners identify optimal store locations and 
            product assortments?
            - Which geographic or socioeconomic groups are most associated with higher alcohol 
            consumption or preferences for specific types of liquor?

            <u><b>How to Use</b></u>
            - **Business Perspective:** The algorithm identifies which products sell best in 
            different types of areas (e.g., high-income cities may prefer Item B). This enables liquor 
            owners to tailor product assortments based on local demographics to maximize sales and 
            reduce inventory risk.
            - **Policy Perspective:** The model can help policymakers identify areas with high 
            predicted alcohol consumption, allowing for targeted interventions to mitigate public 
            health risks. It may also help local governments optimize alcohol-related tax revenues.

    1. `month`: [Months](https://data.iowa.gov/Sales-Distribution/Iowa-Liquor-Sales/m3tr-qhgy/about_data). Assumes season is one of the important factors influencing consumers' liquor preference.
    2. `s_(store type)`: [Store types](https://data.iowa.gov/Sales-Distribution/Iowa-Liquor-Sales/m3tr-qhgy/about_data). Categories of class "E" liquor selling stores such as: grocery store, liquor store/bar, gas station, pharmacy, distillery/brewery, general store, convenience store, other, or unknown.
    3. `l_(liquor type)`: [Liquor liters by types](https://data.iowa.gov/Sales-Distribution/Iowa-Liquor-Sales/m3tr-qhgy/about_data). Liters for sold liquor types, such as whiskey liqueur, Canadian whisky, and aged rum.
    4. `c_(county)`: Counties. Since we are considering only stores in Iowa, this variable alone is used to capture geographical characteristics when creating the algorithm. However, we conduct exploratory data analysis using the following features to capture the effects of each county-level characteristic on gross profit.
        - [Adult population age brackets by gender](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/iowa-population-18-years-and-over-by-sex-age-and-educational-attainment-acs-5-year-estimat?): This variable includes adult age categorized into the following buckets: (18‚Äì24, 25‚Äì34, 35‚Äì44, 45‚Äì64, and 65+) at the county level, separating male and female populations.
        - [Annual income](https://data.iowa.gov/Economic-Statistics/Annual-Personal-Income-for-State-of-Iowa-by-County/st2k-2ti2/about_data): Denotes the county level average income.
        - [Fuel sales](https://data.iowa.gov/Sales-Distribution/Iowa-Motor-Fuel-Sales-by-County-and-Year/hbwp-wys3/about_data) (Used as an interaction term when store type is gas station): Total motor fuel sold during the 2024 calendar year, measured in gallons.
        - [Excessive drinking percentage](https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/health-data/community-conditions/health-infrastructure/health-promotion-and-harm-reduction/excessive-drinking?state=19&tab=1&year=2025): Percentage of adults reporting binge or heavy drinking in the past 30 days.

st.markdown('''
            - **Observational data only:** We cannot infer causal relationships as this 
            model is only predictive.
            - **Limited external validity:** A model trained on Iowa may not generalize 
            to other states, especially non-Midwestern ones.
            - **Complex interpretation:** Using many features makes it hard to pinpoint 
            individual drivers, particularly after regularization.
            - **Scope of sales data:** We only have liquor transaction, not inventory data. 
            Additionally, they do not include beer, wine, or cider.
            - **Missing ancillary purchases:** There‚Äôs no data on complementary food or 
            non‚Äëliquor drinks, which could affect gross profit.
