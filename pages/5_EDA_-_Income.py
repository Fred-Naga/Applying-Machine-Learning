            In this section we explore income throughout Iowa's counties. In particular, we check to see how it interacts with liquor sales gross profit. We're particularly interested if there is correlation between the two, as the majority of counties in Iowa have an average income lower than 75k, and to see if there's any deviation from an expected increase in profits when income increases.
