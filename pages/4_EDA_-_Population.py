            This section investigates how population characteristics, including gender and age, 
            relate to liquor store gross profit in Iowa. By visualizing spatial and 
            demographic patterns, we aim to understand whether densely populated areas or certain 
            population segments are associated with higher alcohol-related revenue. We also explore 
            seasonal variations to detect possible trends in consumer behavior across different 
            times of the year.
