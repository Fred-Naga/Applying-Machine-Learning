               - To capture seasonal patterns, we focused on four 
                representative months: January (winter), April (spring), 
                July (summer), and October (fall).
                - Spatial distribution of gross profit remains relatively 
                consistent across these months, with clusters of high profit 
                concentrated in a few urban areas.
                - This concentration likely reflects underlying population 
                density and economic activity, rather than seasonal shifts.
