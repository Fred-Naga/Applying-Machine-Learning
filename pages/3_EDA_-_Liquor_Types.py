            In this section, we explore how liquor types contribute to gross profit across Iowa. 
            Using state- and county-level sales data, we visualize the total gross profit generated by each liquor type and examine regional preferences.
            Additionally, we consider preferences of different price brackets across a range of salaries. This allows for quick identification of which products are most profitable and how consumption patterns vary by location.
